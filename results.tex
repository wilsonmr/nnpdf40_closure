\section{Numerical Setup and Results}

In this Section we first introduce the experimental setup used to run the
closure tests, and then discuss the actual results: following the study performed in 
Ref.~\cite{nnpdf30}, we first analyse the relative 
size of different component of PDFs uncertainties, comparing the changes between the old
and the new methodologies, used to produce the NNPDF3.1 and NNPDF4.0 sets of PDFs respectively; 
we then move to data space estimators, which have been computed only for NNPDF4.0
\footnote{comment about the fact that this is possible thanks to the fact that the code is now much faster}.
The results here act both as a proof of principle of new estimators presented in this paper but also
as part of a suite of methodological validation tools, see also the "future
tests" \cite{Cruz_Martinez_2021}, used to understand the PDF uncertainties of
the recent NNPDF4.0 set of PDFs. For the purpose of understanding how the
results here were produced, we will briefly describe the key features of the
NNPDF4.0 methodology, but refer the reader to NNPDF4.0 for a full discussion on
how these methodological choices were made, and the impact on performing PDF
fits to experimental data.

\subsection{Neural network parton distribution functions}

Using neural networks to fit PDFs has been discussed many times in previous
NNPDF publications, see for example \cite{nnpdf30, Ball_2017}. A new feature of
NNPDF4.0 will be that, for the default fit performed in the evolution basis, a
single neural network parameterises all 8 PDF flavours $\{ g, \Sigma, V, V_3,
V_8, T_3, T_8, T_{15} \}$ at the initial scale. The PDF for a single flavour $j$,
at the initial scale $Q_0 = 1.65~{\rm GeV}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    f_j(x, Q_0) = NN(x, \ln x | \modelvec)_j * x^{1-\alpha_j} * (1-x)^{\beta_j},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the preprocessing exponents, which control the
PDF behaviour at $x \to 0$ and $x \to 1$ respectively and $NN(x, \ln x |
\modelvec)_j$ is the $j^{\rm th}$ output of the neural network, which takes $x$
and $\ln x$ as input. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:fit-reps}, an ensemble of
models is fitted, each one is an MAP estimator of the corresponding pseudo-data
it is fitted on. 
An optimization algorithm is used to try and find the parameters which maximise the likelihood.
In principle, the preprocessing exponents can also be varied during the fit
analogously to the neural network parameters, such as in \cite{Carrazza_2019},
or they can be randomly selected from a predetermined range as is done in
previous NNPDF releases, for example \cite{Ball_2017}. There are clearly many
choices with respect to hyperparameters, the discussion of how these choices
have been made is beyond the scope of this paper and left to the full NNPDF4.0
release \cite{NNPDF40}. A summary of the hyperparameters used to produce results
presented in this paper are provided in Tab.~\ref{tab:Hyperparams}.

%Something like the following should go in Sec 3, when defining the forward map for NNPDF
%Finally, the parton distributions themselves are not compared directly with
%data. Instead the observables quantities are obtained by performing convolutions
%with the PDFs, as discussed in \ref{eq:DISExample}. In practice the observables
%are obtained by convoluting the PDFs with FastKernel tables, presented in
%\cite{Ball_2010,Bertone_2017}, for each data point. The convolution depends on
%the process type of the observable, for DIS-like observables, such as in
%Eq.~\ref{eq:DISExample}, the convolution is performed with a single PDF. For
%hadronic observables the convolution is performed between two PDFs. 


\subsection{Closure test setup}

As input to the closure test, a single replica was drawn randomly from a
previous NNPDF fit to experimental data. We refer to this as the underlying law
and the corresponding predictions the true observable values. An example of the
gluon input is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:InputGluonPDF}. In principle any
function could be used as underlying law, however it makes sense to use a
realistic input.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8 \textwidth]{plot_pdfs_g.png}
    \caption{The green line is the input underlying law for the gluon PDF,
    which is sampled from the ensemble from a fit to data. The 68\% confidence
    interval is plotted for those replicas as the orange band.}
    \label{fig:InputGluonPDF}
\end{figure}

The observables used in the fits are a subset of the full NNPDF4.0 dataset. For
convenience, we chose to fit the PDFs on a variant of the NNPDF3.1 dataset used
in Ref.~\cite{Ball_2018}, which is described in detail in a study of the
determination of the strange PDF~\cite{Faura_2020}. The datasets used in the
calculation of statistical estimators are the new datasets which will be
included in NNPDF4.0, which will be discussed in detail with the main release.
For a full summary of observables used in the test data and a visual
representation of the kinematic region of both the training and testing data,
see App.~\ref{sec:appendix-datasets}.

The choice of data for both fitting and testing is considered unimportant, one
could consider splitting the data into training and test in a way which
considered kinematic coverage rather than this naive chronological splitting.
Alternatively, since the data is generated from the theory predictions produced
by the input underlying law, one could even produce completely artificial data
using a different set of FK tables. From a practical standpoint, using the
NNPDF3.1 dataset and validating on the newly included datasets in 4.0 allowed us
to validate the PDF uncertainities on data outside of the kinematic coverage of
data included in the fit. Furthermore, the data estimators only give us local
information on the PDF uncertainties and it seems logical to split the data in
this way since the results seem more applicable to the reality of how the PDFs
end up being used.

We then generate 30 different sets of experimental central values (or L1 data),
as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:closure-test-intro}, for the fitted 3.1-like
dataset. Each set of experimental central values was then fitted following
NNPDF4.0 methodology \cite{NNPDF40}, producing 40 pseudo-data replicas.

%When comparing with the old NNPDF methodology, we use the minimization algorithm
%of Ref.~\cite{nnpdf30}. An important iingredient of previous NNPDF minimization
%procedure was the choice of a stopping criterion. XXX

\subsection{Errors on PDFs}

As already discussed in Ref.~\cite{nnpdf30}, fitting to L0, L1 and L2
pseudo-data allows us to validate different aspects of the fitting procedure. In
an L0 fit, we fit multiple time the exact same set of data, which corresponds to
the theory prediction from the chosen model. The fitted pseudo-data is the
result obtained by applying the forward map to the model. It is clear that in
this case the quality of the fit can be improved at will, provided that the
parametrization is flexible enough and the minimization algorithm is efficient.
There are indeed multiple solutions that reproduce exactly the data set, while
interpolating between the data points. In an L1 the data have been fluctuated
around the theoretical prediction -- mimicking thereby the central values of
experimental measurements. The true model no longer reproduces the data; instead
it will yield a $\chi^2$ of order one. The pseudo-data are held fixed,
fluctuations from one replica to the next are due to the existence of multiple
solutions that hold a similar value for the residual $\chi^2$ at the end of the
minimization process. Finally, in the L2 fits, the fluctuations of the data are
reproduced by the replicas, and propagated to the model function when fitting
the data for each replica. Since the NNPDF fitting methodology has changed in
the latest release, it is important to compare the uncertainties at L0, L1 and
L2 that are obtained with the new fitting rouitne (n3fit) with the corresponding
ones obtained with the old fitting code (nnfit). 

An example of these relative errors on fitted PDFs is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CT_uncertainty_g}
for the case of the gluon distribution: L0, L1 and L2 closure tests are displayed on the same plot, each one
normalized to the corresponding central value. 
We note how the L0 and L1 uncertainties are the dominant ones in the $x$ regions where less experimental data are available,
namely at small and large-$x$, where the model is left unconstrained and free to fluctuate, while they are considerably
reduced in the data region. Here the L2 error, induced by the actual experimental data, is the dominant one.

It is interesting to compare these results with what we find with the old fitting code. The corresponding
plots are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CT_uncertainty_g_nnpdf3.1}: the PDF error 
is mainly dominated by the L0 uncertainty, even in those kinematic regions where experimental data are present.
This is in agreement with the results of Ref.~\cite{nnpdf30}, where it was shown that 
data uncertainties are not dominant anywhere.

This is clearly not the case for the results obtained with the new methodology.
This, most likely, is due to the different optimizers used in NNPDF4.0, which has been proved to be much more efficient 
than the genetic algorithm, adopted in the previous NNPDF determinations.

\subsection{Bias-variance ratio}

We calculated $\biasvarratio$ on the test data, shown in
Tab.~\ref{tab:summarise_new_data}. An
uncertainty on $\biasvarratio$ by performing a bootstrap sample
\cite{efron1994introduction},
where we randomly sample from both fits and replicas and re-calculate
$\biasvarratio$, the value and error presented in the table is then the mean
and standard deviation across bootstrap samples. We checked that the distribution
of the estimator across bootstrap samples is indeed Gaussian. We also checked
that increasing the number of fits and replicas reduced the bootstrap error but
the central values were the same within the estimated bootstrap uncertainities.

\begin{table}[hb]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
            \toprule
            {}     &  $\biasvarratio$ \\
            \midrule
            Total  &  $1.03\pm0.05$   \\
            \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{
        The bias-variance ratio, $\biasvarratio$, for unseen data, summarised in
        Tab.~\ref{tab:summarise_new_data}. The uncertainty is estimated by
        performing a bootstrap sample across fits and replicas and calculating
        the standard deviation. We see that overall $\biasvarratio$ is consistent
        with 1, within uncertainities. This gives a good indication that, at least
        for the unseen data used in this study, the uncertainities are faithful.
    }
    \label{tab:biasvarratio}
\end{table}

One can also compare qualitatively the distribution of bias across fits, to the
distribution of the difference between replica predictions and expectation
values of predictions (in units of the covariance) across different fits
and replicas. The square root ratio of the mean of these two distributions
is precisely $\biasvarratio$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8 \textwidth]{plot_bias_variance_distributions_total.png}
    \caption{The green histogram is the distribution of the total bias across fits,
    the orange histogram is the distribution of the difference between the
    replica and central predictions squared, in units of the covariance
    across all fits and replicas. This gives a qualitative picture of the full
    distribution, in Tab.~\ref{tab:biasvarratio} we compare the square root of the
    mean of each distribution.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison to quantile statistics}

As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:QuantileStatistics}, one can define an analogous
estimator in data space, based upon $\xi_{n\sigma}$, which was defined on a grid
of points in $x$ and $Q^2$ in PDF space in \cite{nnpdf30}. There is not
a one-to-one correspondence
between this and $\biasvarratio$, but a loose approximation using
Eq.~\ref{eq:expectedxi}. In Tab.~\ref{tab:xicomparison} we compare the estimated
$\xi_{1\sigma}$ from
subsituting $\biasvarratio$ into Eq.~\ref{eq:expectedxi} and to the
measured value.

\begin{table}[hb]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
            \toprule
            {}     & $\xi_{1\sigma}$ & $\erf(\biasvarratio/\sqrt{2})$ \\
            \midrule
            Total  & $0.69\pm0.02$   & $0.67\pm0.03$                  \\
            \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{
        Comparing the measured value of $\xi_1\sigma$ and the estimated
        value from $\biasvarratio$. The two values are consistent, which
        suggests the approximation that the ratio of uncertainties is
        approximately the same across all data is not completely invalidated.
        Not only are the measured value and estimated value from $\biasvarratio$
        self consistent, but they are also consistent with $0.68$, which
        further supports the argument that the model uncertainities are
        faithful.
    }
    \label{tab:xicomparison}
\end{table}

Despite the assumptions entering each of the two estimators differing, we see
good agreement between the $\xi_{1\sigma}$ estimated from $\biasvarratio$
and that measured directly. We find this result reassuring, since it indicates
not only that the total uncertainty averaged across all data is faithful, but
also that the uncertainty on each data point seems faithful. If the results
differed it would indicate some kind of imbalance, where some components
of the uncertainty are correctly represented by the replicas but other directions
are not.
