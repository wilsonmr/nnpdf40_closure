\section{Results}
\paragraph{Note}{Do we want results in and out of sample? Still don't
fully understand in sample results. Need to add finite replica/fit results}

Also need to define list of datasets and new vs old processes

\subsection{Data space estimators}

\paragraph{Note}{Add bias and variance across fits to show respective spreads}

\paragraph{Note}{Add xi across datapoints for each experiment}

First we show $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ by experiment for data
not included in the fit, but old processes.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_sqrt_ratio.tex}

Next we show the same estimator, $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$, by
experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes

\input{latex_tables/fullout_sqrt_ratio.tex}

Now we compare the measured $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated $\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment
for data not included in the fit, old processes. To estimate $\xi_{1\sigma}$
we we take $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ and substitute into
eq. \eqref{eq:expectedxi}, assuming that $\frac{\sigma_i}{\modelstd_i}$ is
constant across datapoints and equal to $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_xicomp.tex}

Similarly, we compare the same estimators $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated
$\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes.

\input{latex_tables/fullout_xicomp.tex}

\subsection{PDF space estimators}

TODO.
