\begin{abstract}
    We discuss the Bayesian approach to the solution of inverse problems and apply it to the
    closure tests performed by the NNPDF collaboration. Starting from a comparison with
    the approach that is currently used for the determination of parton distributions 
    (PDFs) by the NNPDF collaboration, we discuss analytical results that can be obtained for 
    linear problems and use these results as a guidance for the more complicated non-linear problems. 
    We show that, in the case of Gaussian distributions, the posterior probability density
    of the parametrized PDFs is fully determined by the results of the NNPDF fitting procedure. 
    We introduce new estimators to assess the statistical faithfulness of the fit results in 
    closure tests. These estimators are defined in data space, and can be studied analytically 
    using the Bayesian formalism in the linear model in order to gain some insight on their
    meaning. Finally we present numerical results from a number of closure tests performed 
    with current NNPDF methodologies. As PDFs determinations move into precision territory, 
    the need for a careful validation of the methodology becomes increasingly important: the error
    bar has become the focal point of contemporary PDFs determinations. In this perspective,
    theoretical assumptions and other sources of error are best formulated and analysed
    in the Bayesian framework, which provides an ideal language to address the address the 
    precision and the accuracy of current fits.
