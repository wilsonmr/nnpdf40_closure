\label{sec:ResultsFitted}

Here is a summary of the data and settings used during the global closure test
fits discussed in this report.

\subsection{Data space estimators}

First we show $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ by experiment
for data included in the fit.

Now we compare the measured $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated $\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment
for data included in the fit.
