\section{Results - fitted data}
\label{sec:ResultsFitted}

Here is a summary of the data and settings used during the global closure test
fits discussed in this report.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:dataset_summary}
    \input{latex_tables/dataset_summary}
    \caption{Summary of the fitted data used to compute the statistical estimators.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data space estimators}

First we show $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ by experiment
for data included in the fit.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:fitted_sqrt_ratio}
    \input{latex_tables/fitted_sqrt_ratio}
    \caption{Bias/variance ratio for each experiment, using data included in the fit.}
\end{table}

Now we compare the measured $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated $\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment
for data included in the fit.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:fitted_xicomp}
    \input{latex_tables/fitted_xicomp}
    \caption{Comparison between the measured value of $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and the value predicted from the bias/variance ratio for each experiment, using data included in the fit.}
\end{table}
