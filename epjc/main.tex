\abstract{
  We discuss the Bayesian approach to the solution of inverse problems and
  apply the formalism to analyse the closure tests performed by the NNPDF
  collaboration. Starting from a comparison with the approach that is
  currently used for the determination of parton distributions (PDFs),
  we discuss some analytical results that can be obtained
  for linear problems and use these results as a guidance for more
  complicated non-linear problems. We show that, in the case of Gaussian
  distributions, the posterior probability density of the parametrized PDFs is
  fully determined by the results of the NNPDF fitting procedure.
  Building on the insight that we obtain from the analytical results, 
  we introduce new estimators to assess the statistical faithfulness of the fit results in closure tests. 
  These estimators are defined in data space, and can be studied analytically using
  the Bayesian formalism in a linear model in order to clarify their meaning.
  Finally we present results from a number of closure tests
  performed with current NNPDF methodologies. These further tests allow us to
  validate the NNPDF4.0 methodology and provide a quantitative comparison of the
  NNPDF4.0 and NNPDF3.1 methodologies. As PDFs determinations move into precision
  territory, the need for a careful validation of the methodology becomes
  increasingly important: the error bar has become the focal point of
  contemporary PDFs determinations. In this perspective, theoretical
  assumptions and other sources of error are best formulated and analysed in
  the Bayesian framework, which provides an ideal language to address the
  precision and the accuracy of current fits.
