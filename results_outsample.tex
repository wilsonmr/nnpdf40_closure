\section{Results - data not fitted}

We look at the statistical estimators computed using data which was not fitted,
we split that data into two groups: new processes and old processes. Since we
are looking at closure test data which has not been fitted, we ignore any double
counting in the data - for example jet measurements with different jet radii, or
different single top distributions.

\subsection{Out of sample data, New processes}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:summarise_fullout_data}
    \input{latex_tables/summarise_fullout_data}
    \caption{Summary of the new processes, out of sample data used to compute the statistical estimators.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Out of sample data, Old process}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:summarise_partial_data}
    \input{latex_tables/summarise_partial_data}
    \caption{Summary of the old processes, out of sample data used to compute the statistical estimators.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data space estimators}

First we show $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ by experiment for
data not included in the fit, but old processes.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:partialout_sqrt_ratio}
    \input{latex_tables/partialout_sqrt_ratio}
    \caption{Bias/variance ratio for each experiment, using data not included in the fit, old processes.}
\end{table}

Next we show the same estimator, $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$,
by experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:fullout_sqrt_ratio}
    \input{latex_tables/fullout_sqrt_ratio}
    \caption{Bias/variance ratio for each experiment, using data not included in the fit, new processes.}
\end{table}

Now we compare the measured $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated $\xi_{1\sigma}$ by
experiment for data not included in the fit, old processes. To estimate
$\xi_{1\sigma}$ we we take $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ and
substitute into eq. \eqref{eq:expectedxi}, assuming that
$\frac{\sigma_i}{\modelstd_i}$ is constant across datapoints and equal to
$\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:partialout_xicomp}
    \input{latex_tables/partialout_xicomp}
    \caption{Comparison between the measured value of $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and the value predicted from the bias/variance ratio for each experiment, using data not included in the fit, old processes.}
\end{table}

Similarly, we compare the same estimators $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated
$\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \label{tab:fullout_xicomp}
    \input{latex_tables/fullout_xicomp}
    \caption{Comparison between the measured value of $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and the value predicted from the bias/variance ratio for each experiment, using data not included in the fit, new processes.}
\end{table}

We now show $\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for data which was not fitted, old processes.
Split up by experiment, each scatter point is $\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for a given
datapoint in the basis which diagonalises the respective experimental covariance
matrix.

There is no noticeable trend between new and old processes with the data which
was not fitted. Potentially we can condense the above plots significantly. At
least into just 4 plots (by experiment). The results would change slightly
due to the basis being different.
