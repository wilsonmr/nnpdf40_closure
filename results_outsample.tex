\section{Results - data not fitted}
\paragraph{Note}{Do we want results in and out of sample? Still don't
fully understand in sample results. Need to add finite replica/fit results}

Also need to define list of datasets and new vs old processes

\subsection{Data space estimators}

\paragraph{Note}{Add bias and variance across fits to show respective spreads}

First we show $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ by experiment for data
not included in the fit, but old processes.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_sqrt_ratio.tex}

Next we show the same estimator, $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$, by
experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes

\input{latex_tables/fullout_sqrt_ratio.tex}

Now we compare the measured $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated $\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment
for data not included in the fit, old processes. To estimate $\xi_{1\sigma}$
we we take $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ and substitute into
eq. \eqref{eq:expectedxi}, assuming that $\frac{\sigma_i}{\modelstd_i}$ is
constant across datapoints and equal to $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_xicomp.tex}

Similarly, we compare the same estimators $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated
$\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes.

\input{latex_tables/fullout_xicomp.tex}

We now show $\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for data which was not fitted, old processes. Split
up by experiment, each scatter point is $\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for a given datapoint
in the basis which diagonalises the respective experimental covariance matrix.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6 \textwidth]{out_oldproc_cms_xi.pdf}
    \caption{$\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for CMS datasets which were not fitted
    but are old processes, in the basis which diagonalises the experimental
    covariance matrix}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6 \textwidth]{out_oldproc_lhcb_xi.pdf}
    \caption{$\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for LHCb datasets which were not fitted
    but are old processes, in the basis which diagonalises the experimental
    covariance matrix}
    \label{fig:outoldlhcbxi}
\end{figure}

Now the corresponding plots for data which was not fitted, new processes.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6 \textwidth]{out_newproc_atlas_xi.pdf}
    \caption{$\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for ATLAS datasets which were not fitted
    and are new processes, in the basis which diagonalises the experimental
    covariance matrix}
    \label{fig:outnewatlasxi}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6 \textwidth]{out_newproc_cms_xi.pdf}
    \caption{$\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for CMS datasets which were not fitted
    and are new processes, in the basis which diagonalises the experimental
    covariance matrix}
    \label{fig:outnewcmsxi}
\end{figure}

There is no noticeable trend between new and old processes with the data which
was not fitted. Potentially we can condense the above plots significantly. At
least into just 4 plots (by experiment). The results would change slightly
due to the basis being different.
