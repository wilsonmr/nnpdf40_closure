\section{Results - data not fitted}

We look at the statistical estimators for data which was not fitted, we split
that data into two groups: new processes and old processes. Since we are looking
at closure test data which has not been fitted, we ignore any double counting
in the data - for example jet measurements with different jet radii,
or different single top distributions.

\subsection{Out of sample data, New processes}

\subsection{Out of sample data, Old process}

\input{latex_tables/summarise_partial_data.tex}

\subsection{Data space estimators}

First we show $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ by experiment for data
not included in the fit, but old processes.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_sqrt_ratio.tex}

Next we show the same estimator, $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$, by
experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes

\input{latex_tables/fullout_sqrt_ratio.tex}

Now we compare the measured $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated $\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment
for data not included in the fit, old processes. To estimate $\xi_{1\sigma}$
we we take $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$ and substitute into
eq. \eqref{eq:expectedxi}, assuming that $\frac{\sigma_i}{\modelstd_i}$ is
constant across datapoints and equal to $\sqrt{\frac{\eshift{\bias}}{\eshift{\var}}}$.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_xicomp.tex}

Similarly, we compare the same estimators $\xi_{1\sigma}$ and estimated
$\xi_{1\sigma}$ by experiment for data not included in the fit, new processes.

\input{latex_tables/fullout_xicomp.tex}

We now show $\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for data which was not fitted, old processes. Split
up by experiment, each scatter point is $\xi_{1\sigma}^{i}$ for a given datapoint
in the basis which diagonalises the respective experimental covariance matrix.

Now the corresponding plots for data which was not fitted, new processes.

There is no noticeable trend between new and old processes with the data which
was not fitted. Potentially we can condense the above plots significantly. At
least into just 4 plots (by experiment). The results would change slightly
due to the basis being different.
