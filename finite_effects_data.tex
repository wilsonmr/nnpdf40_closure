\section{Finite effects - data space estimators}

\subsection{New data, new processes}

We first show the bias and variance of each fit to see how stable
the variance is across fits compared to the bias for new data, new processes.
The variance is expected to be
independent of the level 1 shift and so we assume any variation is due to finite
number of replicas.

    \caption{Bias and variance for each fit for all new data, new processes. Each
    fit has 40 replicas. The variance is still fluctuating a fair amount and
    so results may be subject to finite statistics effects.}
    \label{fig:outnewfitbiasvar}
\end{figure}

Next we use bootstrapping to try and gauge the dependence of the error on the
number of fits and replicas. Using the full set of fits and replicas as the sample
we draw a random subset of $\nfits$ fits and for each fit a random subset of $\nreps$
replicas. We then
calculate the estimators discussed in previous sections for the resample of fits
and replicas. For each value of $\nfits$ and $\nreps$ we perform 100 bootstraps
and then take the mean and standard deviation of the estimator across bootstrap
samples. Finally we vary $\nfits$ and $\nreps$ and tabulate the results in order
to get an idea of the dependence of the error on increasing the number of fits
or replicas without having the redo any fits.

First we show the mean of bias/variance across bootstrap samples, varying
$\nfits$ and $\nreps$

\input{latex_tables/fullout_finite_effects_ratio_mean.tex}

Now the standard deviation across bootstrap samples of bias/variance, varying
$\nfits$ and $\nreps$

\input{latex_tables/fullout_finite_effects_ratio_error.tex}

Now we show the corresponding tables for the $\xi_{1\sigma}$ estimator. First
the mean across bootstrap samples

\input{latex_tables/fullout_finite_effects_xi_mean.tex}

Now the standard deviation across bootstrap samples

\input{latex_tables/fullout_finite_effects_xi_error.tex}

\subsection{New data, old processes}

We include the same results for new data, old processes. The results are very
consistent with those calculated with new data, new processes and so we might
want to just group all new data together.

First the mean across boostrap samples of bias/variance.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_finite_effects_ratio_mean.tex}

Next the corresponding standard deviation across boostrap samples.

\input{latex_tables/partialout_finite_effects_ratio_error.tex}

Now we show the resampled results for the $\xi_{1\sigma}$ estimator. First
the mean across bootstrap samples

\input{latex_tables/partialout_finite_effects_xi_means.tex}

and the corresponding standard deviations across bootstrap samples

\input{latex_tables/partialout_finite_effects_xi_error.tex}
